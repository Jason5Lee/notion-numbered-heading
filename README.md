Uses jiahaog/Nativefier to build Notion with my own custom CSS and Electron settings
I do not really like Electron, but Notion is just so nice and easy to use.

- Install Nativefier, on Arch you can find it in the AUR under nodejs-nativefier
- Run build
- Notion is now installed in repo folder and a desktop file is create for your used that links to this repo folder
